        ">I joined Deep Dive Coding to finally dip my toes into the data science world. Iâ€™ve been working with data for over 21 years across different platforms and companies, and honestly, I just love it. What excites me most is taking data that looks random or meaningless and helping organizations see the hidden value in it â€” the insights, the stories, and the opportunities for growth.\n",

        "Iâ€™d pick the head of a lion. Lions are known to be fearless, determined, and lead with authority. I like to think of myself in a similar way: when I set a goal, I go after it with that same intensity and focus. At the same time, lions donâ€™t just lead through dominance; they protect and mentor their pride. Iâ€™d want to embody that balance â€” being aggressive enough to get things done, but also guiding and supporting others so the whole team grows stronger.\n",

        "Hereâ€™s why: without email, Iâ€™d basically vanish from the world â€” nobody would know where to find me. The password keeper is a must, because letâ€™s be real, Iâ€™ve got about 374 different accounts and only remember the password to my Prime account. And of course, the bank app â€” because if I canâ€™t check whether I can afford burritos this week, whatâ€™s the point of having a phone at all?\n",

Give me Celine Dion belting her heart out, Christina Aguilera reminding us all about that genie in the bottle, and Lionel Richie saying hello â€” and yes, I sing along loudly, badly, and with zero shame.\n",
